# Cleaning bulk RNA-seq cancer expression data

## Goals

The purpose of this project is to provide ground work for developing more
advanced methods for determining the exclusive expression profile of cancer
cells in bulk RNA-seq data.

Bulk sequencing data is relatively abundant, and therefore a good resource for
developing machine learning models for diagnosis and treatment development in
cancer research [citation needed]. However bulk samples obtained from tumors are
not guaranteed to contain purely cancer cells, rendering the expression profiles
obtained from whole bulk RNA-sequencing of the samples inaccurate for the
expression profile of cancer cells themselves. A method reliably quantifying and
reducing the inaccurracy would therefore accelerate method development of
machine learning methods in cancer research by unlocking the potential of cancer
bulk RNA-seq data as training material.

The methods are currently tested using pseudobulk data obtained by sampling UMI
single-cell RNA-seq data to obtain bulk RNA-seq data with known celltype
abundances and celltype expression profiles.

## Current status

We have working pseudobulk generation & deconvolution using non-negative least
squares. Signature matrices are generated by identifying differentially
expressed (and therefore informative) genes using
[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html), and
using them to construct the signature matrix.

Fine tuning is needed in selecting the marker genes for the signature matrix.
